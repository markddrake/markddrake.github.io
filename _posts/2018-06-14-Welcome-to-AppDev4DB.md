Welcome to APPDEV4DB, the blog of Mark D Drake. I am a product manager, based in the Bay Area. I've been in tech for well over 25 years, both in the UK and USA.  My primary focus to date has been on application development and database management, most recently for non-relational data. More about me later (maybe).

This blog is a new venture for me so we'll see where it goes but I'm going to start of by looking at how to use the JSON generation features of Oracle 12.2 and 18 to develop a simple JSON based replacement for the traditional Oracle EXP and IMP utilities.  Since the code for this project is available on [Github](https://github.com/markddrake/JSONExport4Oracle), I'll continue this as project specific blog over [there](http://markddrake.github.io/JSONExchange)) for the moment.
